# support multiple accounts from auth provider

# Feature: Multiple Account Support

## Problem Statement

Currently, OpenCal only supports one account per calendar provider (Google). However, users often have multiple Google accounts (work, personal, school, etc.) and need to switch between them.

## Proposed Solution

Implement support for multiple accounts per provider with:

1. **Account Identification**: Store account metadata (email, name, provider-specific ID)
2. **Account Management**: Add, remove, switch, and list accounts
3. **Active Account Concept**: Maintain a default/active account per provider
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Migrate existing single-account setups seamlessly

## Key Changes Needed

### CLI Command Updates
- opencal auth add <provider> - Add new account
- opencal auth switch <provider> [account-id] - Switch active account
- opencal auth remove <provider> [account-id] - Remove account
- opencal auth list - Enhanced to show all accounts

### Implementation Phases
- Phase 1: Storage Schema Migration
- Phase 2: CLI Implementation
- Phase 3: TUI Integration
- Phase 4: Testing & Polish

### Acceptance Criteria
- Multiple Google accounts can be authenticated simultaneously
- Account switching works without re-authentication
- Active account persists across application restarts
- Account metadata (email, name) is correctly stored and displayed
- Existing single-account setups migrate automatically
