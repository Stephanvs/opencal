# Add Winston logging library and replace console.log with Winston loggers

## Summary

- Add winston logging library to the project.
- Replace all console.log statements with winston loggers.
- Create a core folder where the default logger is initialized, importable via @core/logger.
- The logger should write logs to default OS-specific locations (macOS, Linux, Windows).
- Make it extensible for tools like Kibana later (not in scope now).
